# Sequelize-CLI
  1.sequelize-cli is a command-line interface tool for Sequelize
  2.What is it used for?
    The CLI helps you manage your database workflow through the command line. Its main uses include:
    -> Database Management:
      1. Initialize Sequelize in your project
      2. Create and manage database configurations
      3. Run database migrations (schema changes)
      4. Seed your database with test or initial data.

    -> Code Generation:
      1. Generate model files (representing database tables)
      2. Generate migration files (for creating/modifying tables)
      3. Generate seeder files (for inserting data)

  3.Why use it?
    I. It's particularly useful because it helps you maintain database version control through migrations, making it easier to collaborate with teams and deploy database changes consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).
    II.  Instead of manually writing SQL or creating tables, you define changes in JavaScript/TypeScript files that can be tracked in version control.
  
  4.Common Commands:
    1. npx sequelize-cli init                                                                   # Initialize Sequelize in your project
    2. npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string,email:string  # Create a new model and migration
    3. npx sequelize-cli db:migrate                                                             # Run all pending migrations
    4. npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo                                                        # Undo the last migration
    5. npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-users                                        # Create a seeder file
    6. npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all                                                            # Run all seeders
