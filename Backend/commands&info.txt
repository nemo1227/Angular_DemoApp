# 
 1. express -> Web Framework
 2. cors -> Handle cross-origin requests 
 3. dotenv -> Load environment variables from .env
 4. nodemon -> Auto-restarts server on file changes (dev only)
 5. sequelize -> ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
 6. jsonwebtoken -> login tokens

ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique that provides a bridge between object-oriented programming 
languages and relational databases.It allows developers to interact with a database using the objects and concepts of their 
chosen programming language, rather than writing raw SQL queries.

How ORM Works:
 1.Mapping: ORM frameworks establish a mapping between objects in your code (e.g., a User object) and tables in a relational database 
   (e.g., a users table). Properties of the object (like name, email) are mapped to columns in the table.
 2.Abstraction: ORM provides an abstraction layer that hides the complexities of SQL and database interactions. Instead of writing SQL 
   statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, you perform these operations directly on your objects.
 3.Translation: The ORM framework translates your object-oriented operations into corresponding SQL queries that the database can understand 
   and execute. It then translates the results back into objects that your application can use.
