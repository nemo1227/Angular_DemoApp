ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique that provides a bridge between object-oriented programming 
languages and relational databases.It allows developers to interact with a database using the objects and concepts of their 
chosen programming language, rather than writing raw SQL queries.

How ORM Works:
 1.Mapping: ORM frameworks establish a mapping between objects in your code (e.g., a User object) and tables in a relational database 
   (e.g., a users table). Properties of the object (like name, email) are mapped to columns in the table.
 2.Abstraction: ORM provides an abstraction layer that hides the complexities of SQL and database interactions. Instead of writing SQL 
   statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, you perform these operations directly on your objects.
 3.Translation: The ORM framework translates your object-oriented operations into corresponding SQL queries that the database can understand 
   and execute. It then translates the results back into objects that your application can use.


What is DevOps & Why DevOps?
 1. DevOps is all about getting teams to build and deploy code faster without sacrificing reliability.
 2. Before DevOps, development and operations teams worked separately with minimal communication. Developers would build software in their own environment, then hand it off to operations to deploy it to users.
 3. But operations couldn't immediately deploy the code. They needed to carefully test it first, make sure it wouldn't break existing systems, and prepare the infrastructure - all without knowing how the code was written.
 4. This created delays, misunderstandings, and frustration on both sides: developers wanted to ship features quickly, while operations wanted to make sure the code is stable before it's deployed.

DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software.
At the heart of DevOps is CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.

What does DevOps Engineeers do?
 1. Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.
 2. Containerize applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.
 3. Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.

CI (Continuous Integration):
 CI (continuous integration) means the build process starts automatically - whenever developers update the code in GitHub (i.e. a new recipe is added), CodeBuild will automatically build the updated code.

CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):
 CD (continuous delivery) means deployment happens automatically whenever a new build is successful.
